# Hi there, I'm Shyam Sankar P 👋

## About Me

I'm a passionate UI/UX designer and full-stack developer based in Cyberpark, currently working at Limenzy. With expertise in PHP, Laravel, Python, and a keen interest in Machine Learning and AI, I'm always exploring innovative solutions at the intersection of design and technology. I also have hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, MERN stack (Node.js, React), and JavaSript.

Outside of coding, I'm a sports enthusiast, indulging in activities like rugby, sailing, kayaking, and surfing. I'm actively involved in extracurricular activities, having been a part of organizations like NSS, Palliative, SIP (Students Initiative for Palliative), and serving as a core member of Kerala Shastra Sahitya Parishath.
